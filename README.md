Investment Calculator
A simple investment calculator app built using Angular for the frontend and NestJS for the backend. I'm planning to add more functionalities to it in the future.
This is a demo app where I practiced my skills in forms, routing, and using NestJS to send and fetch data from a database.

Someday, I will add more functionality, improve the design, and enhance the logic. For now, it has limited functionalityâ€”it takes inputs and generates outputs.
